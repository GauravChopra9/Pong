# Pong
Implemented the use of cross platform python modules in the Pygame library to build and design a 2 dimensional, minimalist
and friendly graphical user interface pong game. 

The player and the pong ball were made using Rect objects in pygame and the ball is controlled using direction velocities. The game logic is designed to cause the ball to collide when it hits the player and the game restarts if it hits the wall behind the players.The game can litsen to certain keys on the keyboard to move the players.
